I had the huge privelidge of working on part of the [Matemarote project]() during my PhD. I wanted to write a short post in which I showcase part of the project, and in particular the goals that my work had within the bigger project. I wont go into all the details as those can be found in the papers[some citations]().

### Small foreword on the Matemarote project

Matemarote is an educational framework aimed for young children (in between 5 to 7 years old). The kids get to play three tailored made computer games that are designed to exercise something called _cognitive functions_. Broadly speaking, these are low level skills, such as planning and impulse control (technically inhibitory control), that vastly affect our everyday activities. The main focus of the study was to explore if the games helped improve some educational markers at school (which [they do]()).

### So what do I have to do in all of this?

The big picture and the big goals of Matemarote were purely socio-educational. However, the parents of the children that participated in the studies gave their consent for us to gather the data on how they played the games they played. This big dataset gaves us the oportunity to try to study behavior, decision making and planning using tools borrowed from data science and artificial intelligence. That's where I came in!
